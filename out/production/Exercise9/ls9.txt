Topics and Titles for a Capstone Project for Information Technology
One of the areas that give students the most problems with capstone projects for information technology is coming up with a topic and title for their project. Being told to come up with something that hasn’t been done before intimidates some students but it isn’t as difficult as it may first appear.

Selecting the wrong IT capstone project topics for your research can be a real disaster. If you select something that you simply are unable to complete or you find so boring or uninteresting it can be hard to finish your capstone. You must ensure that you take the time to fully understand what is expected of you when you are selecting that all important topic area.

Good ideas for IT capstone project writing must not be simply unique. It must revolve around an issue for which there is no best solution. It must also be important. By that there must be some value to you solving the matter that you have identified. While the issue does not have to be completely unique and unknown, your solution should be. Even if there are solutions to the issue, if you think you have a better more efficient answer then there is no reason why you should not use this as your project. The important thing is that you use what you have learned to successfully solve a problem in a unique way.

Take care however to choose something that is of sufficient size to warrant your capstone investigation. If you can hammer out a solution in a day then it is not going to make for much of a project. It must also allow you to demonstrate the skills that you have gained throughout the taught portion of your program. The difficulty of your project should reflect the level you are within your education.

Remember, you will often have to complete an IT capstone project proposal before you will be able to even start your work. This must show that your topic area is important and unique as well as demonstrating that your project is completely feasible. That is you will be able to complete it with a high likelihood of success with the time and resources you have available to you. If you cannot demonstrate this then it is unlikely that you will be allowed to continue with your project.

When considering topics and titles for a capstone project for information technology keep the following things in mind:

Don’t go off in a completely new direction.You are supposed to in part be demonstrating what you have learned. Avoid topics in a completely new area you have never studied.
Look back at your class work. Reading back through your notes can often trigger ideas for your project that will be perfectly suitable for your capstone. You will often have been posed many studies within your work and you may have already highlighted many issues within this field.
Think back on any work experience. Often if you have done any work experience or even had full-time employment you will have encountered many real problems in your field that will need solving. This is often the best source of topics for your IT senior capstone projects as it allows you to solve a real-world issue with immediate value.
Work with your tutor or peers. You can brainstorm ideas with others. By feeding off of what others suggest you can often find many additional topics that will be suitable for your research. Working together can be a highly effective way to generate the ideas that you need.
Read in areas that interest you. Often if you read past papers, articles and other writing you will find issues that may interest you. Past papers will also often detail where research is weak as well as highlighting areas for additional research. So reading in the subject areas that interest you is often a very fertile area for the best IT capstone project ideas or capstone project ideas for networking.
Look at lists of potential projects. Our IT capstone project writing service can provide you with long lists of potential ideas for your research. While a list may not contain the specific project that interests you it may trigger ideas that you can build on to find your own.
When titling your project be descriptive. Use a title that describes what your project is or does. When a reader sees the title of your paper they should know what it is going to be about.
Don’t use a title that is too broad or too narrow. A good topic and title should provide a focus for your work. Something that is too broad such as “investigation into cybersecurity” simply has too many options that you could follow. You should also avoid anything that is so focused that there is simply nothing known about it.
